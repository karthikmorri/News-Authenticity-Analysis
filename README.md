# News-Authenticity-Analysis

 In an era marked by the rapid proliferation of digital information, the authenticity of news has become a critical concern for both consumers and media organizations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of news authenticity through the application of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. We explore a diverse dataset comprising news articles from various sources, categorized by credibility, and analyze key features that distinguish authentic news from misleading or false information. By implementing these four advanced algorithms, we conduct a comparative evaluation to assess classification accuracy and robustness in detecting misinformation. Our results demonstrate that Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms significantly 
outperform traditional methods, achieving improved precision and recall rates. This research highlights the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for enhancing news verification processes, ultimately 
contributing to the development of more reliable information dissemination frameworks. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of automated solutions in combating misinformation, setting the stage for 
future advancements in media literacy and public trust in journalism.
